## Interactive-Data-Visualization-for-Personal-Income-Analysis-using-R

# Project Description: 

This project analyzes a dataset on personal income, focusing on four countries—USA, India, Colombia, and England—to predict whether an individual’s income is greater than or less than 50,000. The purpose of the project is to understand how various continuous (age, hours worked) and categorical (sex, education, race, etc.) variables influence personal income. The project uses R and Shiny to create an interactive data visualization tool that allows users to explore trends and correlations in personal income. It also aims to provide insights that can help governments and organizations improve GDP through targeted policy interventions.

# Objectives of the Assignment:

- Analyze the impact of continuous variables like age and hours worked on personal income.
- Examine how categorical factors like sex, race, education, and work class affect income.
- Provide a detailed analysis for four countries: USA, India, Colombia, and England.
- Develop an interactive visualization tool using R and Shiny for real-time data exploration.

 # Key Findings:

- The USA has the highest number of individuals earning more than 50,000 due to its larger population and higher GDP.
- There is a positive correlation between the number of hours worked and higher income.
- Age has a direct impact on income, with older individuals earning more due to experience, though this trend reverses near retirement age.
- Higher education levels, particularly bachelor’s and master’s degrees, are strongly associated with higher incomes.

# Technologies Used:

- R: For data processing and analysis.
- Shiny: For creating an interactive web application to visualize data.
- R Libraries: ggplot2, dplyr, and shiny.

# How to Run the Code:

1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Install the required R libraries using install.packages().
3. Open the project in RStudio or a similar IDE.
4. Run the Shiny app using the shinyApp() function or by selecting "Run App" in RStudio.
5. Interact with the visualizations to explore the data and answer the business questions.
